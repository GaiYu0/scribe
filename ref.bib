  abstract = {This paper contains a new approach toward a theory of robust estimation;
	it treats in detail the asymptotic theory of estimating a location
	parameter for contaminated normal distributions, and exhibits estimators--intermediaries
	between sample mean and sample median--that are asymptotically most
	robust (in a sense to be specified) among all translation invariant
	estimators.},
